# Corner-Centrality
A new measure of centrality of nodes in a Multilayer Network. 
This method defines the target layer, which contains the nodes to analyze the importance. All layers must define
a value of importance for every node in the target layer. 
The fundamental steps of this new measure are:
* For every node of the target layer and for every layer, define the importance of every node
* Integrate the layer's importance to the node in a unique value.
